# Ayur

## Inspiration üí°

Taking medicine on time is a must, but sometimes we forget due to our busy schedules. That's why we created Ayur, a personal medicine scheduler that ensures you never miss a dose. Its standout feature is reminding not only you but also alerting designated contacts by making a call if you haven't taken your medicine.

## What it does ‚ùì

-   Schedules medicine for you.
-   Sends reminders to your phone.
-   If reminders are ignored, it makes a call (making sure you don't skip your medicine).
-   Analyzes symptoms and provides possible causes and precautions using PaLM 2.

## How we built it ü§î

technology used:
We utilized the following technologies:

-   Flask: for building the API.
-   PostgreSQL: for data storage.
-   Gunicorn: for hosting the API.
-   PaLM 2: to suggest possible causes and precautions.
-   Flutter: to design the user interface.
-   Twilio: for user authentication and phone call reminders.

## Challenges we ran into üß†

-   Running a process in the background and triggering a function at a scheduled time on Android.
-   Implementing phone call functionality if the user didn't respond to the medicine notification. We achieved this by using time-triggered Azure functions and periodic checks.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of üòé

We take pride in the following achievements:

-   Completing the project within the specified time limit.
-   Utilizing Marshmallow and flask-smorest to create a structured API, even though it required some extra time.
-   Leveraging the PaLM 2 model to suggest causes and precautions.

## What we learned üìù

Throughout this project, we gained valuable insights and learned to use various technologies, including:

-   Flask-smorest, Flask-JWT, Marshmallow, Azure functions, and Cron Job for backend development.
-   Method channels and function scheduling for the Android side.
-   Utilizing PaLM 2 by Google to analyze symptoms.

## What's next for Ayur ü§ñ

-   Enhanced User Experience: We're committed to refining the app's interface and usability based on user feedback. Seamlessly navigating through the app and managing health will become even more intuitive.
-   AI Advancements: Ayur will continually evolve its AI capabilities, ensuring more accurate symptom analysis and providing even better recommendations for causes and precautions.
-   Customized Health Insights: We aim to offer personalized health insights based on an individual's medical history, preferences, and lifestyle. Tailoring suggestions will make Ayur an indispensable health companion.
